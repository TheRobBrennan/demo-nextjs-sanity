Attendees of [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf/) were provided a special link to sign up for Sanity at [https://www.sanity.io/nextjsconf](https://www.sanity.io/nextjsconf). The [Next.js Conf](https://www.sanity.io/pricing/nextjsconf-dev-2020-10-20) plan - a super-charged, amped up, dev plan with twice the normal monthly usage: 200k API requests, 1m API CDN requests, 10GB asset storage and 20GB Bandwidth - is free, and a great way to get started with [Sanity.IO](https://www.sanity.io/). No credit card required, either.
