This repo explores the integration of the [Sanity.IO](https://www.sanity.io/) Content Management System (CMS) with Next.js.

Prerequisites:

- You must have an account on [Sanity.IO](https://www.sanity.io/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) must be installed on your development machine
- OPTIONAL: You must have an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) if you would like to deploy your application publicly

# Resources

Attendees of [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf/) were provided a special link to sign up for Sanity at [https://www.sanity.io/nextjsconf](https://www.sanity.io/nextjsconf). The [Next.js Conf](https://www.sanity.io/pricing/nextjsconf-dev-2020-10-20) plan - a super-charged, amped up, dev plan with twice the normal monthly usage: 200k API requests, 1m API CDN requests, 10GB asset storage and 20GB Bandwidth - is free, and a great way to get started with [Sanity.IO](https://www.sanity.io/). No credit card required, either.

## Sanity E-commerce example with Next.js frontend, deployed to Vercel

[Sanity.IO](https://www.sanity.io/) offers an e-commerce example with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) frontend, deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Simply click [here](https://create.sanity.io/?template=sanity-io/sanity-template-nextjs-ecommerce&_ga=2.153671544.1119025031.1603822316-1095608187.1603822316) to get going.

You can view the [DEMO](https://demo-sanity-next-js-e-commerce.vercel.app) app deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) at [https://demo-sanity-next-js-e-commerce.vercel.app](https://demo-sanity-next-js-e-commerce.vercel.app)

I was impressed by how seamless the Sanity.IO template tool was for this example. After signing up for my free Sanity.IO account, it took approximately seven (7) minutes for the process to:

- Create a new [Sanity.IO](https://www.sanity.io/) project for my demo app
- Create a new repo on GitHub (GitLab and Bitbucket were also options)
- Deploy the application to a new [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) project with environment variables defined already
